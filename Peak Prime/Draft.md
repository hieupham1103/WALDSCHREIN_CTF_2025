The leak gives the top 512‚àÅE5 bits of q, leaving only 25 unknown lower
bits.

That reduces q to a small search window (about 33 million integers), but
by iterating only primes in that window the search becomes practical.

Once q is found, factoring n is trivial, allowing RSA decryption to
recover the plaintext flag.

solve_peak_prime.py is a solver that:

Parses the leaked values,

Iterates prime candidates for q in the constrained range,

Factors n, computes d, and decrypts the ciphertext to print the flag.

Finally, after brute forcing, we got the flag
